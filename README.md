I have two idea's, so maybe you could provide feedback on which one sounds better:

### Single Song: The House of the rising Sun
The house of the rising sun is an old folk song. And like most folksongs the exact origins and author are unknown. The oldest published lyrics were written down by  Robert Winslow Gordon, an academic collector of folk songs, in 1925. Throughout the last century many different covers of the song have been made with many different styles. I would like to look at a large collection of different covers and see if all these drastically different versions have things in common or whether I can group them into different types of covers (other than just the genre on which the cover is based).

This corpus is rather specific. There are still over hundreds of covers, but I don't know whether 'one' song can provide enough to base a good research question on.

### Genre evolution: Soul vs. Neo soul legends
Soul is a genre that started in the fifties and sixties originating from the African American Gospel music and Rythm and Blues. Throughout the decades there have been many legends from the early Ray Charles, Sam Cooke, to the 'Queen of soul' Aretha Franklin and Marvin Gaye to the more recent Neo-Soul legends like Lauren Hill, Erykah Badu and D'Angelo that appeared in the nineties. I would like to look at the difference between the 'classic' soul from the late 50's to 70's and the Neo soul from the 90's and maybe early 2000's. 

This corpus is very broad. I've looked into the classification of Spotify as regarding genres and I would have to look further into which sub genres, they produce, I would include in the final corpus. Or I could try and compare specific artists, but I feel that would become to narrow.
